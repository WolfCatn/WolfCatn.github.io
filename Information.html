                <p>This is my first website that I've ever made. 
                    I am very new to coding and I love it so far.
                    At first, it was very confusing. But once I got the hang of it, I realized how  easy it really is.
                    So far, my favorite type of coding is HTML. 
                    It could just be because it was the first one I learned, and I find it to be easy.
                    Maybe when I learn more about the other types, I'll find one I like more than HTML.
                    Who knows though... 
                </p>
                <p>I think for me, the hardest part about coding is first understanding it and first using it.
                    Once I know how to use it and have tried it a couple times, it makes it pretty easy for me to get the hang of it.
