            <body>
                <p>Hey there! My name is Nigh. I am 17 years old, and a senior in high school. 
                I am a middle child. I have 5 brothers, 3 older and 2 younger; I also have a sister who's older than me.</p>
                <p>I have many passions, things I like to do; 
                but most recently, I've found myself doing a lot of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cooking</li>
                    <li>Reading</li>
                    <li>Listening to music</li>
                    <li>Playing D&D</li>
                    <li>Scrolling through Pinterest</li>
                    <li>Playing Minecraft</li>
                    <li>Tennis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                My favorite type of music is alternative rock. 
                However, I will sometimes listen to a wide variety of music.
                The main types of music I won't listen to and don't really like is country, jazz, and blues. 
                Some country is okay, but not most of it to me.
                </p>
                <p>Now to answer a common question people have: what do you want to do when you're older?
                    For me the answer is go to college, get my degree, and work in a field I love. 
                    As of right now, I applied for the criminology major at the University of Idaho and got accepted. 
                    That will be my primary choice. I found out I love criminology when I took my first forensic science class my sophmore year.
                    However, if that doesn't work out or becomes too much for me to handle, I have another option.
                    I also want to major or at least minor in psychology. 
                    I think it'd be cool, if I don't go into criminology, to become a social worker.
                </p>
                <p>Why you might ask? Because of the way social workers have changed my life. 
                    I want to help change kids' life who are struggling with mental health the way my social worker/therapists have helped me.
                </p>
